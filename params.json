{"tagline":"Toast Open Automation System for Test","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nTOAST is short for \"Toast Open Automation System for Test\". \r\n\r\nGeneral speaking, it's a tool to run your automation test case/code in a specific test box and then show the test result back to you via Email notification or from web UI test result page.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Basic Design  \r\n\r\nAbout automation test case, actually if a test case was automated, a corresponding test code (usually based on a specific programming test framework, such as Xunit, Selenium or etc.) having been written already, from running aspect we look test code (usually a test method in souce code) as test case. Test code is built to excutable binary and it will run on a test box against deployed test environment. Since test code is written based on a framework, the output is formatted. Once toast get the output of test code, after parsing output, we can know how many case passed or failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Setup \r\n\r\nTOAST compose of three parts:\r\n  * Front End, including Web UI and DB.\r\n  * Back End, or Controller.\r\n  * Test Box, we call it as \"test agent\" or \"agent\".\r\n\r\nfor each part installation, see [install link](http://github.com/taobao/toast/install).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nHere is the whole process,\r\n  * write a script(shell, batch file etc) which can drive your test code running. \r\n  * keep the scirpt in a specific test box.\r\n  * add this test box into toast machine pool.\r\n  * in toast web UI, create a test job and input required information, such as: crontab run time, test machine, test stage, test command in each test stage, test case parser for each test command and so on.\r\n  * manaully run this job, or by crontab.\r\n  * get test result return from remote test box and parse case information.\r\n  * test report will show how many cases have been passed or failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug tracker\r\n\r\nHave a bug or a feature request?
